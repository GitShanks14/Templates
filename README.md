# Templates
Contains the general structures of code for commonly occurring problems. Solely to paste and edit snippets to boost my coding speeds.

Templates for common data structure based problems, and code structures/functions that commonly appear while working on the following classes of tasks will be placed here:
1. Arduino
2. Python functions written in C++
3. Common data structure setups in C++ and Python
4. Templates for multithreaded code in C++ and Python
5. Basic bio informatics

Note: Incomplete and plan suspended possibly indefinitely
